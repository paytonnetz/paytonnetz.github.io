    <p>The Earth does not revolve around the Sun on a perpendicular axis. It is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to our orbital plane. This tilt is formally called obliquity. The tilt is believed to have been incurred due to a collision with a planet-sized sized body called Theia. Not only did the collision tilt the planet, but the resulting debris is believed to have concentrated mid-air to form our moon.</p>
