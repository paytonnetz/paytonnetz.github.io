      <P>Winter begins Saturday, December 21 and ends on Thursday, March 19th. Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones (winter does not occur in most of the tropical zone). It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Don't like winter? Better stay away from Montana!</P>
