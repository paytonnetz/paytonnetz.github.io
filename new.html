    <h1>A Soft Murmur</h1>
    
     <p>Check out a cool website <a href="https://asoftmurmur.com/" target="_new" Title="A Soft Murmur">A Soft Murmur!</a></p>
    
    <p>  About a year ago the internet was taken by storm by these oddly satisfying videos called ASMR. ASMR is a feeling of well-being combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck, as experienced by some people in response to a specific gentle stimulus, often a particular sound. A soft murmur is a website to help wash away distractions with some ASMR sounds. Some sounds include rain, thunder. Waves, wind, fire, birds, crickets, coffee shop, singing bowl, and white noise just to name a few! Right when I opened up this website I thought it was the coolest thing! With a sleek black background and the cutest little icons with the sounds right there a click away! Each icon has its own sound and also its own volume knob. </p>

<p> The maker of this website says “I created A Soft Murmur for myself. I like to work in public spaces like libraries and coffee shops, but they can be noisy and distracting. Listening to ambient helps me focus, and I like being able to mix different sounds together to match the environment I’m in.” From this little website he has found a lot of success! On this website there is also a little blog, it’s not much but it says to keep checking in for more information. This was written in 2017, and this was my least favorite part of this website. I think that Gabriel Brady (The designer of this website) could have had a lot more success if he updates sounds and even wrote funny little blogs about new sound or even ASMR sounds.</p>

<p> From looking at is from this class view point it seems like something I could do with just a little bit more knowledge on web design. The one thing that I would really struggle with when making this is getting those icons, the volume buttons and obviously the sound!

    <h1>The Oatmeal</h1>
    
     <p>Check out another cool website! <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/blog" target="_new" Title="The Oatmeal">The Oatmeal!</a></p>
    <p>
Right when I saw the name of this website I was interested in it! I think that’s a really important thing when making websites, making the name appealing so people click on it and want to see what is on the site. When fist clicking on The Oatmeal I wasn’t disappointed! It’s a website full of memes, comics, blogs and quizzes! You could for sure spend a lot of time on this site. Something really cool about this site is EVERYTHING on it is written, drawn and even coded by Matthem Inman- and he is “The Oatmeal”. He currently lives in Seattle, Washington with his two dogs Rambo and Beatrix. When I went to learn more about this site I saw that the creator doesn’t give out his email but allows fans to post on his Facebook page, and that seemed pretty unique! 

<p>When looking at this site you totally could spend hours on it, and thinking that the creator does it all is even more impressive. It is filled with little comics that are guaranteed to make anyone smile! This site unlike the other one had blogs that were up to date! This is something that I really appreciated about this site, with the other one you were only able to listen to the sounds. This one you are able to read and appreciate this web designers work!</p> 

<p>Looking at is from a web design point of view this would be a little difficult especially because it crucial to be really creative. This is something that I have learned throughout this semester. Being creative with your website really makes it stand out and makes it look awesome! You can make a site anything that you want it to look like! I really liked how Mattem made The Oatmeal uniquely him! I hope by the end of the semester I can do the same thing.

      <h1>Suzanne Collins</h1>
    
     <p>Check out not a so cool website <a href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/" target="_new" Title="Suzanne Collins"> Suzanne Collins </a></p>
    <p>It’s bizarre when you open a website and it says “WELCOMEHi! Thanks for visiting my website. Here’s a picture of me with a rat in Central Park. (what does this have to do with anything!?) If you’ve read my fantasy series, The Underland Chronicles, you will have a clue as to why I chose this photo. If not, you may want to click around and find out a little more about my books. Or visit the Scholastic website for cool games and info!” I am the world’s biggest Hunger Games fan so of course I really wanted to LOVE this site, but sadly it was awful.</p>

    <p>When looking at this site there is a large white gap in the middle of it that doesn’t really make sense, and doesn’t make the page look good. There are also really large gaps between the pictures of the books. It also doesn’t fit the entire page so when you shrink it you have to scroll to see the entire thing.  If you were looking at this from a mobile device it would be extremely difficult to navigate, and really confusing. It also doesn’t fit the entire page so when you shrink it.</p> 

<p>From what I learned in this class I think that this could be done a whole lot better. The Hunger Games are such cool books with awesome visuals! Sadly, the maker of this website chose colors and pictures that don’t fit with the books as well as it could. I think that I could remake this website into something really cool with a little bit more work!
