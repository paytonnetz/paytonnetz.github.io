<p>Dreamhost is also only $2.95 a month and this website is for people who are new to web hosting.  This site would be helpful for me because I am still a beginner. <a href="http://dreamhost.com" target="_new" title="DreamHost website">DreamHost</a></p>
<p>Hostgator is $2.95 a month. Itâ€™s survives include one website, one domain and unlimited traffic. They have another option for $4.95 a month that includes unlimited websites. <a href="Http://hostgator.com" target="new" title="HostGator">HostGator</a></p>
    <p>ACCU webhosting is the third website I pciked. This site has three options that are very simliar to the other two. This one was my least favorite because it was difficult to naviagate through. <a href="http://ACCUwebhosting.com" target="_new" title= "ACCU Web Hosting Website">ACCUwebhosting</a></p>
